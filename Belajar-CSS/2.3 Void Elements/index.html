        William Blake (28 November 1757 &#45; 12 August 1827) was an English
        poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life,
        Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry
        and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his "prophetic works"
        were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in
        proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English
        language".
        <sup><small>[2]</small></sup> His visual artistry led 21st-century
        critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist
        Britain has ever produced".[3] In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in
        the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[4] While he lived in London
        his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced
        a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the
        imagination as "the body of God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7]

        Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his
        idiosyncratic views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his
        expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical
        undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been
        characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[8]
        In fact, he has been said to be "a key early proponent of both
        Romanticism and Nationalism".[9] A committed Christian who was hostile
        to the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised
        religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the
        French and American revolutions.[10][11] Though later he rejected many
        of these political beliefs, he maintained an amiable relationship with
        the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers
        such as Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known influences, the
        singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to classify. The
        19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a
        "glorious luminary",[13] and "a man not forestalled by predecessors, nor
        to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or
        readily surmisable successors".[14]
